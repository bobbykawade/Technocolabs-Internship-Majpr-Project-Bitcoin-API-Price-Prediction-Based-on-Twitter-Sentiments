# Technocolabs-Internship-Major-Project-Bitcoin-API-Price-Prediction-Based-on-Twitter-Sentiments
Project shows that real-time Twitter data can be used to predict market movement of Bitcoin Price. The goal of this project is to prove whether Twitter data relating to cryptocurrencies can be utilized to develop advantageous crypto coin trading strategies. By way of supervised machine learning techniques, have outlined several machine learning pipelines with the objective of identifying cryptocurrency market movement. The prominent alternative currency ex- amined in this paper is Bitcoin (BTC). Our approach to cleaning data and applying supervised learning algorithms such as logistic regression, Decision Tree Classifier, and LDA leads to a final prediction accuracy exceeding 70%. In order to achieve this result, rigorous error analysis is employed in order to ensure that accurate inputs are utilized at each step of the model.
